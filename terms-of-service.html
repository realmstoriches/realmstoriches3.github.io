            <h2>5. Pricing and Payments</h2>
            <h3>5.1. Pricing</h3>
            <p>Prices for our services are listed on the Site and are subject to change without prior notice. All prices are in U.S. Dollars (USD) unless otherwise stated. Prices do not include any applicable taxes, duties, or government charges, which shall be your responsibility.</p>

            <h3>5.2. Payment Acceptance</h3>
            <p>We accept payments via major credit/debit cards and other methods as indicated on our checkout page, processed securely through Stripe. By providing payment information, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to use the designated payment method and authorize us (or our third-party payment processor) to charge your payment method for the total amount of your purchase, including any applicable taxes or fees.</p>

            <h3>5.3. Subscription Services</h3>
            <p>Some services may be offered on a subscription basis (e.g., "Realms to Riches Elite Support," "Digital Growth Monthly"). For subscription services:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Recurring Billing:** You authorize us to charge your designated payment method on a recurring basis (e.g., monthly) for the subscription fee until you cancel.</li>
                <li>**Auto-Renewal:** Subscriptions will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle unless you cancel them prior to the renewal date.</li>
                <li>**Price Changes:** We reserve the right to change subscription fees upon reasonable notice. Your continued use of the subscription after such notice constitutes your agreement to the new fees.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5.4. Refunds</h3>
            <p>Our refund policy varies by service. Please review the specific refund terms applicable to the service you are purchasing. Unless otherwise stated:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**One-Time Services (e.g., Website Design, Brand Kit):** Refunds for one-time services may be considered on a case-by-case basis within **7 days** of purchase, provided that no significant work has commenced or deliverables have been provided. After 7 days, or once significant work has begun, payments are generally non-refundable.</li>
                <li>**Consultation Services:** Refunds for consultation services are generally not offered once the consultation has been delivered or scheduled. If you cancel a scheduled consultation with less than **24 hours notice**, no refund will be issued.</li>
                <li>**Subscription Services:** For monthly subscription services, refunds are generally **not available** for the current billing cycle once payment has been processed. You may cancel your subscription for future billing cycles.</li>
                <li>**Digital Products/Courses:** Due to the nature of digital products and instant access, purchases of digital courses or downloadable materials are generally **non-refundable**.</li>
                <li>**How to Request a Refund:** To request a refund, you must contact us directly via email at <a href="mailto:realmstoriches@gmail.com">realmstoriches@gmail.com</a> within the specified refund period, providing your order details and reason for the request. All refunds are issued at our sole discretion.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5.5. Cancellations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>**Subscription Services:** You may cancel your subscription at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:realmstoriches@gmail.com">realmstoriches@gmail.com</a>. Cancellations will take effect at the end of your current billing cycle. No prorated refunds will be provided for partial months.</li>
                <li>**One-Time Services:** If you wish to cancel a one-time service before work has commenced, a cancellation fee may apply. Once work has begun, the cancellation policy outlined in Section 5.4 (Refunds) will apply.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5.6. Insufficient Funds / Failed Payments</h3>
            <p>If any payment is not successfully settled due to insufficient funds, invalid payment method, or other reasons, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the purchased service(s) until payment is successfully received. A reprocessing fee or late payment fee may apply for failed transactions. You will be responsible for any fees incurred by us as a result of such failed payments.</p>

            <h3>5.7. Chargebacks and Disputes</h3>
            <p>Before initiating a chargeback or dispute with your bank or payment processor, we strongly encourage you to contact us directly to resolve any issues. We are committed to customer satisfaction and will work with you to address legitimate concerns. Initiating a chargeback without prior communication may result in the suspension or termination of your access to our services and future purchases, and may be considered a breach of these Terms.</p>
