            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We may collect personal information about you in various ways:</p>

            <h3>Personal Information You Provide Directly</h3>

            <p>When you access the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device and Browse activity:</p>

                <li>**Cookies and Tracking Technologies:** We use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like browser local storage) to collect this information.

                <li>**Cookie Consent:** Our cookie popup uses your browser's local storage to remember your preference. We do not use third-party tracking cookies unless you explicitly enable them (e.g., through future analytics integrations).</li>
                <li>**[Optional: If you add Google Analytics or similar:]** We use [e.g., Google Analytics] to collect information about site usage.

            <h2>4. Third-Party Websites and Services</h2>
            <p>The Site contains links to third-party websites and services, including affiliate links and payment processors.

            <p>Before visiting and providing any information to any third-party websites, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that website, and take those steps necessary to, in your discretion, protect the privacy of your information.</p>
            <ul>

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

            <h2>6. Security of Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures designed to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
